*! twostepweakiv 2.4.07 1Oct2015
*! authors Finlay-Magnusson-Schaffer
*! addition: TwoStep Robust CS for Linear IV Sep2016 
* Usage:
* <eqn>, <options>         = estimate equation as model=linear/ivprobit/ivtobit.
* <nothing>, <options>     = uses model estimated by ivregress/ivreg2/etc. in memory
*                            if no such model in memory, works as Stata replay and
*                            replays last weakiv estimates. useful for graph tweaking.
* <nothing>, estusewald(*) = same as above but uses stored model
* <nothing>, version       = reports version number, does nothing else

* Version notes:
* 1.0.01	31Jul2013.	First complete working version
* 1.0.02	04Aug2013.	Bug fix in kwt (was ignoring option)
* 1.0.03	05Aug2013.	Renamed weakiv with modified syntax. Minor program restructuring.
* 1.0.04	07Aug2013.	J cset reported. Open-ended and entire-grid csets noted in output.
*						Hyperlinks in output table added; link to sections of help file.
*						"all" option added for graph(.).
* 1.0.05	11Aug2013.	Added support for ivreg2h (Lewbel-type generated IVs).
*						Fixed bug in combination of replay() and graph(all).
* 1.0.06	22Sep2013.	Major update.  Added support for 2-endog-regressor case.
*						Graphing for K=2 case requires Stata 12 (contour) and -surface-.
*						Switch from use of ranktest to use of avar.

*						  with replay can change level vs. estimation table.
*						Various coding reorganizations, fixes and tidying up.
*						Bug fix for iid closed-form CIs when only included exog is constant.
*						Minor bug fix for CLR - numerical precision issues mean it can be
*						  very small and <0, so now take abs(.)
* 1.0.07	11Nov2013.	Minor bug fix for K=2 (would crash in grid search if exactly IDed)
* 1.0.08	15Jan2014.  Added support for FE and FD estimation by xtivreg2 and xtivreg.

* 2.4.04    26Mar2015  	Added support for ivreg2 with factor variables; also general recoding of support
*                       for factor vars using -fvstrip- utility.

* 2.4.08    16Feb2016   Bug fix - cuepoint option with exactly-IDed model was causing LIML code to crash.

* to do: note possible upper limit to points that contour can render; use scatter option instead
*        use mat colnames from saved matrices with xtabond2
*        recommend using LIML or CUE with cuepoint so that automatic graph grid is centred correctly.
*        fix bug that disallows using a string variable for the cluster option
*        consider replacing cholesky(invsym(psi)) with rspi_inv = matpowersym(psi, -0.5)

************************* Prep for transformations **************************************

* If TS or FV operators used, replace with temporary variables.
* Ensures that any transformation are applied to temporary vars.
* Must do at this level since if done in subroutines, temp vars would disappear after return
* Extension "_t" is list with temp vars.
* xtabond2 _t varlists are already transformed
* other _t lists are original varlists and will be overwritten

* Varlists come with full set of factor variables
* fvrevar will create a full set, so some can be all zeros,
* including the base variable.
* Call fvrevar 1 variable at a time so that repetitions lead to same tempvar.
* varlist will have full original set of variables
* varlist1 will have variables with collinear and zeroed-out vars dropped
* varlist_t will have varlist1 with tempvar equivalents
* nvarlist will have number of variables after collinears dropped

* Process depvar

* Macro `citable' is name of Mata matrix with table of either p-values or rejections.
* Handling depends on whether table arrives with p-values (main CI table) or
* rejections (projection-based CI table).  If p-values, need to create rejections table.
* In both cases, rejections table is then collapsed in Mata to speed processing:
* "collapsed" = rows which are not on either side of CI border for any test are dropped.
* CIs are then constructed by looping through Stata rejections table `rtable'.
